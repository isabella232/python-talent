        r"""Searches for jobs using the provided
        [SearchJobsRequest][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.SearchJobsRequest].

        This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive
        job seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to
        receive email alerts about potential job opportunities), and has
        different algorithmic adjustments that are targeted to passive
        job seekers.

        This call constrains the
        [visibility][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.visibility] of jobs
        present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has
        permission to search against.

        Args:
            request (:class:`~.job_service.SearchJobsRequest`):
                The request object. The Request body of the `SearchJobs`
                call.

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            ~.pagers.SearchJobsForAlertAsyncPager:
                Response for SearchJob method.
                Iterating over this object will yield
